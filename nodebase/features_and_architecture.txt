## Architecture

The project is structured as a monorepo, with the main application code located in the `nodebase` directory.

*   **tRPC:** The API is built using tRPC, which provides end-to-end typesafe APIs. The main tRPC router is defined in `nodebase/src/trpc/routers/_app.ts`, and the individual routers are located in the `features` directory.
*   **Serverless Functions:** The `nodebase/src/inngest` directory contains the Inngest functions, which are used for running background jobs.
*   **Prisma:** The database schema is defined in `nodebase/prisma/schema.prisma`.
